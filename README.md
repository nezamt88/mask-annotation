# Predictive Mask Annotation #

This repository is established to annotate masks in a video using an open-source labeling tool.
Labeling all the frames of a video with a great accuracy takes a lot of time and cost. In order to make annotation process faster, we need to use semi-automated or automated labelling methods. Therefore, we need to implement a method to annotate an object in a few frames and the tool keep detecting that object in next frames. Ultimately, we want the tool to annotate all video frames itself after annotating a few frames.
